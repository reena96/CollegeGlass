<p>Wearable smart-devices represent the next stage in mobile computing and Google Glass is the most hotly-anticipated gadget in that space. It is not an extension of your Android smartphone or tablet, but is a whole new gadget in itself that can perform various day to day tasks, without you ever moving your hands. </p>

  <p>The computing headgear unveiled at a Google launch event in 2012 has created lot of excitement. However, though most have read and heard about the Google Glasses, there are only a few who know what it can exactly do. So, here is a look at seven cool features of Google Glass.</p>

<p>Just say the word and Google Glass will take a picture or record a video – you will never have to touch the hardware. The photos and videos will be stored on the 4GB flash memory of the device, and can also be shared on social networking websites or emailed.</p>
<hr>
<i><h1>2.Show Messages</h1></i>
<p>Google Glass will show you text messages as well as emails you receive and allow you to reply to them via voice commands.</p>

<p>If you are in the habit of Googling things a lot, you will find that your task has been made easier by the new Glass. You simply need to ask a question and the device will pull the answer from the internet. For example, you can ask when Taj Mahal was built or to give you a few photographs of the monument and the device will provide appropriate replies on the small screen in front of your eye.</p>
<hr>
<i><h1>4.Show Maps</h1></i>

<p>Google Now, the digital voice assistant from the search giant, has been integrated in this device. It will keep track of your daily habits, such as when you leave for office or the route you take. It will give you alternate routes if there is traffic on the way or give you weather updates periodically, among various other functions.</p>
<hr>
<i><h1>7.Translate</h1></i>
