<p>Welcome to The Almanac of Google Glass, presented by ILLUMINATI. We've collected all the dates and events that are important milestones since Google announced "Project Glass" in April, 2012. You can use the arrow buttons to navigate from section to section (the buttons appear at both the top and bottom of every screen). Enjoy! And if you're new around here, be sure to connect with us and stay in touch.</p>

<p>April 4, 2012: Google Announces "Project Glass"</p>

<p>This is the day it all begins. Google creates a Project Glass account on Google+ and shares its first public post that begins with this mission statement:</p>

<p>We think technology should work for you to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don't.</p>

<p>The Glass team says it wants to "start a conversation" and get public input about what Glass should be. Google also shares the now-famous "One day" video, an early conceptual look at "what [Glass] might enable you to do."</p>



<p>April 5, 2012: Glass is seen in public. Robert Scoble shares photos of himself and Thomas Hawk with Sergey Brin, who's wearing Glass to a charity dinner.</p>

<p>April 12, 2012: Google begins to answer some of the questions that flooded in after Glass' announcement. Designer Isabelle Olsson answers a popular question about compatibility with prescription glasses:</p>

<p>We ideally want Project Glass to work for everyone, and we're experimenting with designs that are meant to be extendable to different types of frames. Many of our team members wear glasses, too, so it's definitely something we're thinking about.</p>

<p>She also shares the first photo of Glass being used with prescription glasses:</p>


<p>April 19, 2012: Although Glass is far from being worn by anyone outside of Google, some of the Glass team members are testing it in their daily lives. Engineer Sebastian Thrun shares this photo of TV host Charlie Rose that was taken #throughglass (but he didnt use the hashtag!):</p>

<p>Its the first known public photo taken with Glass in a real-world situation.</p>

<p>May 23, 2012: Googles Max Braun, part of the Glass team, shows off a number of photos taken through glass at the Google+ Photographer's Conference in San Francisco.</p>

<p>June 27, 2012: Google co-founder Sergey Brin does a planned interruption of the morning keynote at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco. He runs on stage while Vic Gundotra is talking about Google+ and introduces a group of professional skydivers that are currently above the Moscone Center and ready to skydive down while wearing Glass. They do, and the entire thing is shown live on screen to an astonished keynote audience.</p>



<p>After the demo, Google starts taking pre-orders for the "Google Glass Explorer edition" at $1,500. Pre-orders are only taken during the conference and are only open to US-based conference attendees. An estimated 2,000 people place pre-orders to become the first Google Glass Explorers. Google says it expects to begin shipping the device to this group in the first half of 2013.</p>

<p>brin-driving-glassJuly 25, 2012: Google shares a private message from Sergey Brin specifically for Glass Explorers in which he says the group is at "the start of an amazing journey" and warns that he "can't promise it'll be easy, or that everything will run perfectly, but I can promise it will be exciting."</p>

<p>Brin also shares a photo that he recently took while driving with Glass in Montana, and says he was "testing a new mode of Glass which automatically takes a picture every 10 seconds without any distraction or disruption."</p>

<p>August 1, 2012: Around this time, Explorers begin to receive a gift from Google clear paperweights with their Glass GRID number etched on one side.</p>

<p>September 9, 2012: Google partners with Diane Von Furstenberg to use Glass during her show at New York Fashion Week. Models wear Glass on the runway today and later in the week, DVF and Google will post a video showing Fashion Week preparations. The video premieres on September 13 and is said to be the first video shot entirely with Glass.</p>



<p>October 31, 2012: TIME magazine names Glass one of its best inventions of 2012.</p>

<p>January 28-29, 2013: Google hosts its first Glass Foundry event in San Francisco, a two-day hackathon for Glass Explorers/developers to "write code, test it on Glass, and collaborate with other developers." A second Glass Foundry hackathon happens in New York City on February 1-2.</p>

<p>February 20, 2013: Although last year's original Glass Explorers still don't have the device, Google expands the Explorer program with today's launch of the #ifihadglass contest. Google invites the general public to apply by explaining what they'd do with Glass via a tweet or post on Google+ using the hashtag #ifihadglass.</p>

<p>Along with the contest, Google also releases a new video, "How it Feels (through Google Glass)," that offers a mostly realistic look at the Glass user interface.</p>



<p>March 12, 2013: Echoing one of its earliest statements, Google confirms its plans to release a prescription-friendly version of Glass.</p>

<p>March 22, 2013: Although Glass is still only being used inside Google, and the Explorer program is still about a month from launching, West Virginia becomes the first state to propose a bill banning the use of Glass while driving. The bill, HB 3057, would establish the offense of operating a motor vehicle using a wearable computer with a head-mounted display.</p>

<p>March 26, 2013: Google begins notifying the winners of its #ifihadglass contest, and promising them a chance to pre-order Glass within the next few weeks.</p>

<p>April 16, 2013: Glass Goes Public</p>

<p>Today's the day that Glass Explorers start using Glass. In a post written a day later, Google reveals that the first pre-orders from last years I/O conference have been fulfilled and Explorers are wearing Glass for the first time.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the first day that Explorers got to take Glass out into the real world. We've been waiting for this day for a long time, and its been both thrilling and surreal to watch it happen.</p>

<p>For now, Google is only inviting the original Explorers that ordered at last years I/O conference to visit one of three base camps (Mountain View, Los Angeles or New York City) to pick up Glass and go through an hour-long onboarding visit with Glass Guides. The recent #ifihadglass invitees wont get their hands on Glass until later in the year.</p>

<p>April 28, 2013: Explorer Robert Scoble publishes a photo of himself wearing Glass in the shower and declares that the device continued to work after being "full on soaked." The photo goes viral and draws attention around the world  not all of it positive.</p>
<p>May 7, 2013: Google issues the first of its monthly Glass software updates. Since it's May, this one is called XE5. The update includes a change in how Glass does background uploads and expands Google+ notifications, among other things. (See our A History of Google Glass XE Software Updates for more details.)</p>

<p>May 22, 2013: With all of the original I/O Explorers now invited to pick up Glass, Google begins inviting the #ifihadglass contest winners to join the Explorer program.</p>

<p>May 31, 2013: In response to growing public concern, Google announces that it will not approve any Glass apps that use facial recognition at this time and not "without strong privacy protections in place."</p>

<p>June 4, 2013: Google issues the XE6 software update, which is primarily focused on photo improvements. (See our A History of Google Glass XE Software Updates for more details.)</p>

<p>June 12, 2013: Scott Torborg and Star Simpson publish a "teardown" of Google Glass, showing all the parts that make up Glass and concluding that "it's surprisingly simple."</p>

<p>June 20, 2013: Dr. Rafael Grossman, a surgeon at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Maine wears Glass while performing surgery to fit a feeding tube in a patient. His live video and commentary are streamed to a nearby iPad. It's believed to be the first use of Glass during surgery. (Read Dr. Grossman's account of the surgery on his blog.)</p>

<p> Camera: Google Glass has the ability to take photos and record 720p HD video.</p>
<p>Display: The Explorer version of Google Glass uses a Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS)(based on an LCoS chip from Himax Technologies), field-sequential color, LED illuminated display. The display's LED illumination is first P-polarized and then shines through the in-coupling polarizing beam splitter (PBS) to the LCoS panel. The panel reflects the light and alters it to S-polarization at active pixel sites. The in-coupling PBS then reflects the S-polarized areas of light at 45 degrees through the out-coupling beam splitter to a collimating reflector at the other end. Finally, the out-coupling beam splitter (which is a partially reflecting mirror, not a polarizing beam splitter) reflects the collimated light another 45 degrees and into the wearer's eye.</p>
